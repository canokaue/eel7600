# ClaToken

This project is the final delivery of an management-focused program offered at [UFSC](ufsc.br) (Federal University of Santa Catarina - Brazil) called EEL7600 - Fundamentos de Gestão Empresarial, ministered by PhD Helena Flávia Naspolini, in which SebasTião Inácio Matos, Henrique Florian, Luís Cagigal (exchange student from Portugal) and Kaue Cano presented the business model of a blockchain solution with analytics dashboard.


## Contributing
ClaToken was developed (among many other reasons such as technological benchmark, curiosity, interest in Blockchain and so on) to deliver on the final project of EEL7600.

With that in mind, requests, issues and recommendations are welcome, but we're not actively developing this project.

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
